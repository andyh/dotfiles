h1. Andy Henson's Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles to set up my system the way I like it.

h2. Installation

<pre>
	<code>
	git clone git://github.com/andyh/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
	cd ~/.dotfiles
	rake install
	</code>
</pre>
	
Then edit to suit your needs.

Note that I use Mac OS X and bash

Requires DrNic's tabtab gem to be installed (_don't forget to run @install_tabtab@_)

h3. Mategem

Create this script in your path somewhere (_mine is in @/usr/local/bin@_)

<pre>
<code>	
  #!/bin/sh
  
  usage()
  {
       echo "Usage: $(basename $0) <gem>" 1>&2
       exit 1
  }
  
  GEM="$1"
  
  [ -z "$GEM" ] && usage
  mate "$(gem environment gemdir)/gems/$GEM"
</code>
</pre>

Then make it executable:

  @chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mategem@

h3. Autospec/Growl

The growlnotify command line tool needs to be installed and the ZenTest, autotest-growl and autotest-fsevent gems.
